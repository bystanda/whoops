    <h3>Oop! I got you.</h3> <p>I tricked you! Now, don't worry, I'll show you how to get rid of these things. There are two methods to do it really fast. </p><p>1. Quit/Force quit chrome. This method is super fast, but if you have other windows open, possibly with sensitive stuff, it will not save them. To force quit, do <span>Command+Option+Escape</span></p><p>2. Close all tabs manually. The way you do this is by hitting <span>Command+W</span> a bunch of times. This closes every tab once it comes up. This is slower, but still pretty fast. It doesn't kill any chrome tabs that you were actively working on.</p><p>Sorry! I intentionally only made it 15 windows so it wouldn't be that bad. Much better than me doing <span>Control+Command+Power</span>...</p>
